                `You should prepare a crate with comfortable mattess inside, some pee pads, some treats and leash and a fence.
                 The pee pads for useful because puppy doesn't know where to pee&poop, the pee pads has some substancles to attract dog to pee on it.
                 once the dog pees on it, he/she would comes back the next time.
                 Puppy would be nervous the first time you drive home, so putting puppy into the crate is actually a GOOD thing.
                 Puppy feels safe in a tight space, if you throws puppy some treats, puppy would know crate is safe and has food!
                `,
                `Your first night with puppy woul be rough, because puppy needs to pee every 1/2 hours, you can't lock the puppy into crate
                thats where the fence comes in, you could fence around the puppy and let crate door open. Your puppy might have separation anxiation,
                my experience has been throwing significant amount of treats into crate and maybe a toy into it to keep puppy busy and eventually tire out.
                At that momement, anxiery is gone. If you're lucky, your puppy will sleep through the night.
                `,
                ` House training should be done ASAP, pee pads only works for small breed, but house still stinks even for small amount of urine.
                My suggestion is to take the puppy out every one hour, on leash, if the puppy pees/poops, rewards puppy nicely and go back to home.
                When arrived at home, unleash the puppy as another rewards. Puppy learn the reward process well, so puppy will actually hold the pee
                until next time out.
                `,
                `Vaccines are needed for puppy, puppy should be taken to vet in first few days for check up and vet would recommend a vaccine schedule.
                Rabi vaccine is must have for puppy. 
                I found the vet price is a lot cheaper in suburban than city, it's could be 50% difference, might be worth the drive`,
                `Training puppy takes a lot of time, but the rule of thumb has been rewarding when puppy action well, reward at the time of action.
                For example, puppy pees at the right place - rewards generously. 
                It could be somestimes tough to train puppy, it takes consistency to train, for my first month I was really occupied with training.
                But I didn't give up. For some amount of work, your workload should be less and less, eventually come to good dog.
                I fully believe bad dog = bad owner, therefore it's a lot of responsbility to train dog so they can go outside and meet people
